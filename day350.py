# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments.
# Each line in the file contains a single word.
#
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.


import random

words = []
with open('lista.txt', 'r') as f:
  line = f.readline().strip()
  words.append(line)
  while line:
    line = f.readline().strip()
    words.append(line)

random_index = random.randint(0, len(words))

print("Random word: ", words[random_index])
